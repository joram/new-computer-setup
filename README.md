# New Computer Setup
this is to setup a new linux (debian based) computer.
It installs all the basic tools I (john) like/need to feel at home.

To run it, to pull/edit the code:
```
apt install git
git clone git@github.com:joram/new-computer-setup.git
cd new-computer-setup
# edit the file before running it
make install_all
```
