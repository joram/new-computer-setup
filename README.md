# New Computer Setup
this is to setup a new linux (debian based) computer.
It installs all the basic tools I (john) like/need to feel at home.


To run it, execute this command:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joram/new-computer-setup/master/setup.sh)
```

or, to pull/edit the code:
```
apt install git
git clone git@github.com:joram/new-computer-setup.git
cd new-computer-setup
# edit the file before running it
bash ./setup.sh
```
